    "\n",
    "Keeping your work in a fork protects the main repository and lets you save\n",
    "progress without merge conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign in at <https://github.com> (create a free account if needed).  \n",
    "2. Visit <https://github.com/MIC-Laboratory/NN-LLM-Journey>.  \n",
    "3. Click **Fork** (top-right).  \n",
    "   *Now you have your own copy of the repo on GitHub.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Option A ‚Äì Local Machine (Recommended if you have a GPU)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Replace the SSH URL with the one from the green ‚ÄúCode‚Äù button in *your* fork\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/NN-LLM-Journey.git\n",
    "cd NN-LLM-Journey\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From here you can create a Conda environment and run the notebooks locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option B - Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefer to work in the cloud? You can run every notebook on a free GPU via\n",
    "Google Colab. Simply connect Colab to your GitHub account following the \n",

    "## 3‚ÄÇEnvironment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using **Miniconda** to manage our environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Miniconda?\n",
    "\n",
    "In ML and DL projects, different labs may require **different versions** of the same packages.  \n",
    "Installing everything globally can lead to **conflicts** and **unpredictable behavior**.  \n",
    "Miniconda lets you create **isolated environments**‚Äîthink of separate ‚Äúrooms‚Äù for each project‚Äîand **reproduce** a full setup from a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1‚ÄÇ-‚ÄÇInstall Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/#installation) to download and install Miniconda on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**  If you already have **Anaconda**, you can skip this‚Äîbut be sure you know how to create and activate Conda envs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2‚ÄÇ-‚ÄÇCreate & Activate the Course Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `environment.yml` in the repo root lists **all** dependencies (it‚Äôs like a `requirements.txt`, but with exact versions).\n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal, from the repository directory, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "conda activate efficientai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you see `(efficientai)` in your prompt, you‚Äôre ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3‚ÄÇ-‚ÄÇVerify & Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "* List installed packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "  conda list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* For other Conda commands, see the [official guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important\n",
    "\n",
    "We will **not** preinstall every library for you‚Äîmanaging environments is a critical skill in research.\n",
    "At the start of each lab, we‚Äôll list any additional packages you need. You must look them up and install them in your active Conda env.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Right now, please install the following packages in the conda environment using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `numpy`\n",
    "* `matplotlib`\n",
    "* `pandas`\n",
    "* `scikit-learn`\n",
    "* `seaborn`\n",
    "* `torch`  *(for PyTorch, follow the [official installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to select the correct command for your system)*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using google colab, you can use the following [instruction](https://colab.research.google.com/github/health-data-science-OR/coding-for-ml/blob/main/content/03_mgt/04_exercises/02_conda.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4 ‚Äî Add Your Conda Environment to Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "You already have your `efficientai` Conda environment‚Äînow let‚Äôs make it available in Jupyter:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Action:** Follow the steps in this [blog post](https://medium.com/@nrk25693/how-to-add-your-conda-environment-to-your-jupyter-notebook-in-just-4-steps-abeab8b8d084) to register your current Conda environment as a Jupyter kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you‚Äôve completed the guide, restart Jupyter and select the new kernel named something like **efficientai (conda)**.  \n",

    "- **Ungraded & Open-Ended**  \n",
    "  This lab is **not** graded and there is **no official solution**. Instead of step-by-step instructions, you‚Äôll work on small projects and experiments that build intuition for ML/AI techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-Directed Exploration**  \n",
    "  We‚Äôll introduce each concept briefly‚Äîits strengths, weaknesses, and a simple baseline. Then you‚Äôll modify or extend it. We won‚Äôt cover every detail (many topics could fill an entire course). It‚Äôs your responsibility to dive deeper as you wish, based on your interests and research goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recommended Completion**  \n",
    "  While labs aren‚Äôt enforced, we **strongly recommend** you complete them. At the end of each lab you‚Äôll find **open-ended questions** to explore further and discuss in our weekly group meeting. These can seed independent projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supplemental Reading**  \n",
    "  We may link papers or blog posts that go beyond the lab. Feel free to read them if you‚Äôre curious‚Äîthey won‚Äôt be addressed in labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI Tools Encouraged**  \n",
    "  You are welcome to use AI assistants (e.g., ChatGPT) to help you code or brainstorm‚Äîbut **make sure you understand** any output you incorporate. Copy-pasting without comprehension defeats the purpose of learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Questions**  \n",
    "  If you have questions about the lab, please first reach out to your mentor.  If you spot an error or typo, open an issue on GitHub with a clear description.  \n",
    "  Your feedback is invaluable‚Äîthank you for helping us improve this course!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5 ‚Äî Feedback & Attendance\n",
    "\n",
    "After each lab, please complete the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPqMvhhVTX0xVST2UDWRkB1vQwnTycv_gu6-cnzJIPvK6jEQ/viewform?usp=dialog). This not only counts as a quick ‚Äúattendance‚Äù check but also lets us adjust future labs based on your feedback. Feel free to highlight any concepts you‚Äôd like expanded or any other suggestions you have.\n",
