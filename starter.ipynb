    "\n",
    "Welcome!  During the next **eight weeks** you‚Äôll build, compress, and deploy\n",
    "neural networks‚Äîfrom a tiny MLP to a quantized, LoRA-tuned language\n",
    "model.  This notebook will help you\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **clone or open** the course repository,  \n",
    "2. **set up** the Python environment,  \n",
    "3. **run a smoke-test** to verify your GPU / CPU works, and  \n",
    "4. learn how to **ask questions** through GitHub Issues.  \n",

    "## 2‚ÄÇGitHub Workflow ‚Äî Work in Your Own Fork\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping your work in a fork protects the main repository and lets you save\n",
    "progress without merge conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign in at <https://github.com> (create a free account if needed).  \n",
    "2. Visit <https://github.com/MIC-Laboratory/NN-LLM-Journey>.  \n",
    "3. Click **Fork** (top-right).  \n",
    "   *Now you have your own copy of the repo on GitHub.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Option A ‚Äì Local Machine (Recommended if you have a GPU)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Replace the SSH URL with the one from the green ‚ÄúCode‚Äù button in *your* fork\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/NN-LLM-Journey.git\n",
    "cd NN-LLM-Journey\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From here you can create a Conda environment and run the notebooks locally.\n",

    "### Option B ‚Äì Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefer to work in the cloud? You can run every notebook on a free GPU via\n",
    "Google Colab. Simply connect Colab to your GitHub account following the \n",

    "## 3‚ÄÇEnvironment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using **Miniconda** to manage our environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Miniconda?\n",
    "\n",
    "In ML and DL projects, different labs may require **different versions** of the same packages.  \n",
    "Installing everything globally can lead to **conflicts** and **unpredictable behavior**.  \n",
    "Miniconda lets you create **isolated environments**‚Äîthink of separate ‚Äúrooms‚Äù for each project‚Äîand **reproduce** a full setup from a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇInstall Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/#installation) to download and install Miniconda on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**  If you already have **Anaconda**, you can skip this‚Äîbut be sure you know how to create and activate Conda envs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇCreate & Activate the Course Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `environment.yml` in the repo root lists **all** dependencies (it‚Äôs like a `requirements.txt`, but with exact versions).\n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal, from the repository directory, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "conda activate efficientai\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you see `(efficientai)` in your prompt, you‚Äôre ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3‚ÄÇ‚Äî‚ÄÇVerify & Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "* List installed packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "  conda list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* For other Conda commands, see the [official guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important\n",
    "\n",
    "We will **not** preinstall every library for you‚Äîmanaging environments is a critical skill in research.\n",
    "At the start of each lab, we‚Äôll list any additional packages you need. You must look them up and install them in your active Conda env.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Right now, please install the following packages using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `numpy`\n",
    "* `matplotlib`\n",
    "* `pandas`\n",
    "* `scikit-learn`\n",
    "* `seaborn`\n",
    "* `torch`  *(for PyTorch, follow the [official installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to select the correct command for your system)*\n",
