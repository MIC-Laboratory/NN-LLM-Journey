    "We will be using miniconda to manage our environment. The first thing you need to do is to install miniconda on to your local machine. The reason we need it is that we often need different version of the same package to run different code and software. However, installing them all on the same machine may cause conflication and unwanted behaviour that are hard to debug. In order to resolve this conflication, we need to create isolated room and easy way to access different environment. In addition we can easily downloading the entire environment without having to go package by package. Conda is a way to do it. Please follow the [official instruction](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install) to download miniconda onto you local machine. \n"
