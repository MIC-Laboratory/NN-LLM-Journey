    "Why do we need it? In machine learning and deep learning projects, we often\n",
    "require **different versions of the same package** for different labs or\n",

    "**conflicts** and **unexpected behavior** that are difficult to debug.\n",

    "Miniconda solves this by creating **isolated environments**, like having\n",
    "separate ‚Äúrooms‚Äù for different projects. It also makes it easy to\n",

    "one-by-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please follow the [official instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/#installation) to download and install Miniconda on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**‚ÄÉIf you already have Anaconda installed, you don‚Äôt need to install Miniconda separately‚Äîbut make sure you know how to create and activate Conda environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where is the conda environment for this lab?\n",
    "- The `environment.yml` file in the root directory describes the exact setup (it is similar to requirement.txt if you have seen it before).\n",
    "- With one command, you‚Äôll recreate the full working environment in minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now please run the following command in your terminal to install the conda environment from the `environment.yml` and activate it\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "conda activate efficientai\n",
    "```\n",
    "you should now see conda environment `(efficientai)` on the left. This means that the environment is being activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Other operations related to conda can be found in the [official document](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html), feel free to play around it. You can now run \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda list\n",
